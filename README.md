Motivation:

- Also I love music things
- Classifiers have been done a million times so here's something more interesting

Goals:
- Learn!
- Learn to test
- Have a good, presentable project
- Have the network make something resembling music
- (Hopefully) be able to identify important priciple components

Definitions:
- Song: a 16 measure piece of music, shape=((16, 96, 96))

(Some) Lessons learned:
- <3000 songs isn't really enough
- https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/207794/what-loss-function-for-multi-class-multi-label-classification-tasks-in-neural-n
- Unit test are hard - need more practice
- Sometimes linux just blows up - use backups
- It's worth setting things up properly before spending time training
- Tensorflow 2.0 isn't as dumb, but it's still a little dumb
